                        <p class="card__body">In this project, I developed an Arduino-based motor control system that
                            uses
                            CAN bus communication and Serial communication to enable real-time control and monitoring of
                            motor operations. The system reads speed and direction data from the GUI. It transmits the
                            controls with serial communication to adjust the motor's behavior and display vital
                            information
                            such as RPM and voltage. The system can then use CAN bus communication to transmit the motor
                            controls to another Arduino motor system, allowing simultaneous control and creating an
                            integrated ecosystem for efficient motor management.

                            incidents in schools, workplaces, and other public buildings by providing real-time
                            situational
                            awareness and guided evacuation. It combines software and hardware components to track
                            shooter
                            locations, calculate safe escape routes, and issue emergency alerts. The system utilizes
                            Python
                            and JavaScript for its backend and frontend, respectively, and integrates with sensor
                            networks
                            for accurate threat detection.

# My Portfolio Website
This website is a passion project of mine that allowed me to learn and refine my skills and also provides somewhere for me to showcase my skill set and ability to bring concepts in my mind to life.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The website uses the basics of CSS and Python while incorporating web kits to make the page vibrant and immersive. 

## Optimizations

Optimizing the page to be responsive to fit any device and screen size meant the website would go through various iterations before being able to be as imagined. Using media queries was my initial method of keeping the page responsive but it was clear the method was very tedious and lacked the ability to fit any screen size effortlessly. To combat this issue I was forced to redesign the entire page. During the redesign, I could commit to a design that kept the page responsive by dividing the page into sections relative to each other.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my very first attempt at building a page with HTML, CSS, and Javascript so every single time I worked on the site I learned something new, whether it was something as minute as making the sections relative to each other to allow them to flow into each other and be visually pleasing or something as important like learning how to implement media queries correctly. I was also able to learn things like how a color scheme can vastly improve the looks of a website and with the help of CSS I was able to include small touches that make the page pop like gradients around the projects that implement the color scheme of the language they were built by, an example would be the blue and yellow around the calculator which are also the colors of the python language
